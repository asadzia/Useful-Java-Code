# Words in Files

A Java application to determine which words occur in the greatest number of files, and for each word, which files they occur in. This program clearly delineates the potency of Hashmaps in Java.

For example, consider you are given the four files: brief1.txt, brief2.txt, brief3.txt, and brief4.txt.

brief1.txt is:

cats are funny and cute

brief2.txt is:

dogs are silly

brief3.txt is:

love animals cats and dogs

brief4.txt is:

love birds and cats

The greatest number of files a word appears in is three, and there are two such words: “cats” and “and”.

“cats” appears in the files: brief1.txt, brief3.txt, brief4.txt

“and” appears in the files: brief1.txt, brief3.txt, brief4.txt
